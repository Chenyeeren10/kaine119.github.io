## Question types
### Factual / Literal Questions
Retrieval of __facts__ from passage.
Will typically involve 5W1H questions (what, who, when, where, why, how)
> e.g. "Why was Michael sent to jail?"

Tips:

* Carefully identify what the question is asking (even "what" questions might ask "what reason", i.e. why)
* Take note of the number of marks given (one mark per main point)

### Inference Questions
Involves textual clues and knowledge of the world to __deduce__ answer.

To give an inference, you need to look for textual evidence and prior knowledge, to determine what the author is __implying__.

You need to provide:

* `Textual clues`
* `Explanation` of how textual clues `answers` the question

>e.g. "The engineer was <doing something>, thus suggesting that <inference>"

### In Your Own Words Questions
> Type 1
> e.g. "In your own words, explain why elephants are dying out."

Obtain points for your answer from the text, and __`rephrase`__ the points using your own words.

* Locate the answer in the text
* Identify __keywords__ or __key ideas__ in the answer
* Replace keywords with synonyms or phrases with similar meanings
* Phrase answer in complete sentence

***

> Type 2
> e.g. "What does the writer mean by 'a chronic illness that plagued the land'?"

Explain what the author means by a word, phrase, sentence or explaination.

* Analyse the given text
* __Paraphrase__ the text such that it fits the __context__ of the passage

### Evaluative Questions

#### Evaluating accuracy of a statement
> e.g. Would you agree that Johnson had a large ego?

Make an evaluation of whether a statement is accurate, and give __evidence__ to support your evaluation.

* State evaluation (Yes/No)
* Give evidence (quote from the passage)
* Explain if needed

***

#### Unusual & effective
> e.g. "Explain why the phrase 'deafening silence' is both unusual and effective."

##### Unusual

Explain how the two parts of the comparison are contradictory.

> i.e.
>"Deafening": a sound so loud it is unbearable
>"silence": no sound is being made
> It's unusual for the two to be paired together as silence is not associated with loudness

##### Effective

Explain why the author decided to put the two parts of the comparison together anyway. The answer might be similar to [Language for impact (effectiveness)](#language-use-language-for-impact)

> i.e.
> 'deafening silence' is effective as it suggest that the silence is unbearable for the protagonist



### Irony Questions
> e.g. "Why is this situation/event ironic?"

Explain how a situation is ironic by explaining how actual events __differ__ from expectations.

Types of irony: 
* Verbal irony: the words of the writer/speaker is clearly the opposite of what he means

> e.g. "Oh, is this young man finally calling it quits?"
> The character is referred to as "young", while in fact he is pushing 60, and obviously not "young".

* Dramatic irony: The use of language has a superficial meaning the characters/narrator is aware of, but also an __inner__, special meaning the reader is aware of


> e.g. "This will be my last hunt"
> The hunt is actually is last hunt, but while David meant it in the sense that he was giving up hunting for good, it was actually because he died.
> OR David meant that he was giving up hunting, but it was his last hunt because he died.

* Situatonal irony: A situation is odd/amusing because what happens is entirely the opposite of what is expected

### Global Questions
Requires understanding of the text as a whole.
> Might be venn diagrams, tables, cloze passages, mindmaps, flowcharts, or "conversations"

### Language Use, Language for Impact
#### Language Use
> Type 1
> e.g. Identify a word that suggests <something>

Pick out a word that creates the __effect__ stated.
**IMPORTANT**: Only pick out the words _required_: do not copy over too much

***

> Type 2
> e.g. What does "snake in the grass" (`phrase`) suggest about Norman (`object`)?

__Infer__ the effect of the a word/phrase.

Strategy:

* __Visualise__ the image of `phrase`

* __Brainstorm__ characteristics or meanings associated with `phrase`

> "snake in the grass": dangerous, sneaky and sly

* __Contextualise__ and choose a suitable meaning applicable to `object`

> Norman's behaviour in the passage is indicative of a sly individual

* __Answer__ and explain the meaning of `phrase` such that it suits the context of the `object`

> A snake in the grass is dangerous and sly, in the same way that Norman (does something...)

#### Langauge for Impact (Effectiveness)
> e.g. Why is "exploded" (`phrase`) an effective word to describe the _ringing of the telephone_(`object`)?

Structure:
`phrase` is `adj describing phrase`, just like the way `object` is `adj describing object`

> i.e. explosions are loud and sudden, just like the way the ringing was loud and sudden.

`phrase` is `adj describing phrase`, emphasising `adj describing object`

> i.e. explosions are loud and sudden, emphasising how he found the telephone ringing loud and sudden.

Strategy:

* __Visualise__ the image of `phrase`

* __Brainstorm__ characteristics or meanings associated with `phrase`

> "explosion": loud, sudden, destructive

* __Contextualise__ and choose a suitable meaning applicable to `object`

> the ringing telephone was loud, sudden <s>and destructive</s>

* __Answer__ and explain the meaning of `phrase` such that it suits the context of the `object`

#### Language for Impact (Evidence)
> e.g. Explain how the language used here makes `object` appear `adj describing object`. Support your ideas with _n_ details from the paragraph

Strats:

* Identify relevant phrases (__details__) based on the keywords of the question
* Interpret the __effect__ of phrases
* Link the effect to keywords in the question
* Phrase the answer to include 
	a. relevant phrases
	b. interpretation of their effect
	c. the link to the keywords in the question
