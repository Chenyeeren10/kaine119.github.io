## Separation Techniques (including drying & collection of gases)
### Sepeartion methods
* Filtration
* Crystallisation
* Evaporation
* Sublimation
* (Fractional) distillation
* Use of a separating funnel
* Paper chromatography

#### Selecting a suitable method
* Solid-solid:
	- Dissolve one in suitable solvent, then filter
	- Sublimation
* Solid-liquid:
	- Solid is soluble (i.e. solution)
		+ If pure substance required: crystallisation
		+ If purity is disregarded: evaporation to dryness
	- Solid is insoluble
		+ filtration
* Liquid-liquid:
	- Immiscible: separating funnel
	- Miscible: fractional distillation

### Drying a gas
* Acidic/Neutral gases: concentrated sulfuric acid
* Acidic/Neutral gases: Fused calcium chloride
* Alkaline gases: Calcium oxide, a.k.a quicklime

### Other miscellanous things to remember
* Rf (chromatography: distance travelled by spot รท distance travelled by solvent)
