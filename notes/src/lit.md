# Narration

- First-person narration
	- Full perspective of protagonist’s thoughts
	- Allows reader to understand the protagonist’s character and feelings, even when they aren’t obvious in action
- Gives insight into protagonists’ attitude towards the happenings
- Shows protagonist’s motives
- Occasionally directly addresses the readers/listeners 
- Emulates the fact that he’s telling a campfire story to others
- Unreliable narrator
- He is biased towards Lina and against other people, so his description of their characters may not be accurate.	

# Literary Devices
- Comparison (Simile)
	- The narrator constantly uses analogies to describe his experiences, which gives the readers a glimpse into his perception of others and how they affect him.
	- [pg. 211] “I felt myself like a lettuce being unwrapped leaf by leaf until my heart lay cupped in her palm.”
	- He likens his conversation with Lina to her physically exposing his deepest vulnerabilities, which reveals 
		- how he views Lina as overwhelming -- a sweeping wave of emotion
		- how the narrator is insecure in the presence of Lina. (or anyone who unravels his inner feelings)

# Diction and Syntax
- “...the feeling, of existing in an inviolable cocoon with your lover…” [pg. 211]
	- He uses the metaphor of being in a cocoon, which shows how he feels a sense of security from his relationship. 
	- However, the usage of the word _“inviolable”_ implies that he is also shutting himself off from the world, escaping from his problems.
	- **slightly negative** connotation of the word _“inviolable”_ reminds readers that he likes privacy, contrasting how he behaves with Lina with how he behaves with others
