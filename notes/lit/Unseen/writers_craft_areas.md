## Plot
![Plot Diagram](./res/plot_diagram.png)

> Not all parts might be present in an _extract_!

* Exposition
	- __setting__!
		- creates an atmosphere for the story
	- Characters introduced
	- __Conflict__ introduced -- a must for any story!
		- _Internal_ conflicts, e.g. a dilemna, a phobia to overcome
		- _External_ conflict, e.g. man vs man, man vs the environment
* Escalating __tension__
	- __Conflict__ escalates
		- Foreshadowing
		- Description of the environment
	- *Suppressed __excitement__* (__suspense__)
* Climax
	- Most exciting part of the story
	- typically a turning point of the story: one character starts to win over another, etc
* Falling action, Resolution
	- Gives closure as to what happens at the end of everything
	- Could be left out; __cliffhangers__ are very popular

## Narration
* 1<sup>st</sup> person
> I, myself
	- More personal, more immediate
		- helps conflict seem more personal, helps increase excitement
	- __biased__: not an omniscient character
		- possibility of an unreliable narrator
	- A better, more detailed understanding of the protagonist
		- an insight to how the narrator thinks

* 2<sup>nd</sup> person
> You're walking in the woods...
	- Not really used that often

* 3<sup>rd</sup> person
> He bumped into her...
	- Detached
	- Overview of whole story
	- Not biased, but also __not personal__
	- Not as immediate as 1<sup>st</sup> person

## Characterisation
- Direct characterisation
> "He was a brave person..."
	- No need for inference
> "Oi! Mr Kiasu!"
	- _namecalling_ requires some inference
	- think of characteristics of said name, see how it applies to character

- Indirect characterisation
> - Background details
> - Description of appearance
> - Actions, thoughts, spoken language
> - External description (i.e. what others say about him)
- Dialogue: can show contrast
> - **Relationships** with different characters
	- Infer character traits based on multiple pieces of info

- Character relationships

- Types of characters
	- Flat characters
	> mostly side characters
		- Does not change, something like a stock character
		- Static

	- Complex characters
	> typically main characters in a story
		- Characteristics will change throughout the story
		- Reacts to certain events differently
		- positive and netative aspects

## Attitude
- i.e. tone of writing
	- Humourous? Authoritative? etc.
	- Can say something about atmosphere
	- Can say something about the protagonist if the story is in first person
- Irony
	- Enhances tone of writing
	- Verbal irony
		- When someone says something when they mean something else
		- "As clear as mud"
	- Situational irony
		- A sharp discrepancy between expected and actual results
		- e.g. A bullet ricocheting off a bulletproof window and hitting someone
	- Dramatic irony
		- A situation where the reader knows something that the characters don't
		- e.g. in Romeo and Juliet: Romeo believes Juliet killed herself, but the audience knows she's just sleeping

## Language
- Literary devices!
	- Imagery
		- Simile and metaphor
		- Personification
		- Contrast
	- Structural devices
		- repetition
		- Alliteration
		- shorter paragraphs vs longer paragraphs: pacing and tension
		- **Physical** *style* <u>of</u> text (i.e. `textdecoration`)
	- Other language devices
		- Onomatopoeia (sounds as words)
		- Assonance
		- Use of certain phonetics (e.g. plosive sounds to imply contempt)
		- Allusions to famous events/people
	- Diction &mdash; meaningful choices of words
		- Connotations
		- Degree of feelings: "annoyed" vs "livid"
		- can help to enhance tone/attitude

- Effects of literary devices
	- on plot
	- on characterisation
	- what mood/feeling does it create?
