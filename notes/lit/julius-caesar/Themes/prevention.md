## Against the rise of power of Caesar
- *Act __2__, scene __1__*
	- Brutus:

		> "might", ... _(repeated hypotheticals)_
		> So Caesar may; / Then lest he may, prevent
		> And since __the quarrel / Will bear no colour for the thing he is__, / Fashion it thus; _[...]_ think him as a serpent's egg, which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous, / And kill him in the shell

		- Nobody can actually say that Caesar will be a danger to Rome
		- Part of Brutus' indecision is the fact that Caesar hasn't actually shown any signs of becoming a tyrant
