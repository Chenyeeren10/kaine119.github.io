# Cassius & Caesar
- Strained, antagonistic
	- Hostility of speech in _Act **1**, Scene **2**_

		> *Cassius:* he doth bestride the narrow world / **like a colossus**, and we **p**etty men / walk under his huge legs, and **p**ee**p** about / to find ourselves dishonourable graves

		- the simile comparing Caesar to the Colossus, a huge bronze statue of the Greek god Apollo, shows Cassius' view of Caesar as a proud, arrogant man who exhalts himself
		- the repetition of the plosive **p** sound in "**p**etty" and "**p**ee**p**" depicts Cassius spitting these words out in utter disdain
