# Julius Caesar

[TOC]

## Very well respected
- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	- Subordinates extremely obedient, almost as if he has an aura of subservience

		> Peace, ho! Caesar speaks!
		> _[Music ceases]_

		> _Caesar_: Hark, who calls?
		> _Casca_: Bid every noise be still; peace, yet again!
		> _[Music ceases]_

		- Those around him seem completely subservient to him
		- They act to suit Caesar's every situation, silence themselves to let Caesar speak

		> When Caesar says, "Do this", it is performed.

		- His subordinates are extremely loyal to him, will act out every command
		- Antony doesn't say this in sarcasm or in bitterness, but in eagerness; Caesar not only has the loyalty of him, but his respect

## Insensitive, not intimate with his wife
- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	- Line 1

		> Calphurnia.
		>> _Later on in the scene_
		>> Antonius.

		- He addresses his wife in the same authoritative, curt manner as he would his subordinates
		- Shows an unintimate relationship

	- lines 6-8

		> Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
		> To touch Calphurnia; for our elders say
		> The barren, touched in this holy chase,
		> Shake off their sterile curse

		- He strongly implies in public that Calphurnia is infertile

## Very superstitious
- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	- Believes in superstitious behaviour

		> Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
		> To touch Calphurnia; for **our elders say**
		> The barren, touched in this holy chase,
		> Shake off their sterile curse

		- He believes in this, to the point where he specially asks Antony to perform such a ritual

	- Keen on ceremony

		> Set on, and **leave no ceromony out**

		- Caesar appears to be very particular about ceromonies

- *Act __2__, scene __2__* 
	- Asks for a divine second opinion

		> *Caesar:* Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, / and bring me their opinions of success.

		- He asks the priests to sacrifice an animal at once, and bring superstitious opinions for success
		- Might show fearfulness on Caesar's part, thus depicting Caesar as [fearful in his personal image](#actually-quite-fearful)

## Arrogance
- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	- Refers to himself in the third person, a __lot__

		> I hear a tongue shriller than all the music / Cry "Caesar!"
		> Speak; Caesar is turned to hear

		- He speaks of himself in the third person
		- Makes him appear arrogant

	- Willing to throw aside superstitious beliefs for the sake of his image

		> He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.

		- Soothsayer comes all the way through the crowd, Caesar carelessly dismisses him
		- Soothsayer repeats his message *thrice*, an especially ominous message telling him to beware a certain date
		- Caesar throws aside his superstitious beliefs to put up his facade of bravado, showing arrogance

- *Act __2__, Scene __2__*
	- Maintains a public image of fearlessness and power

		> *Caesar:* when they shall see / the face of *Caesar*, they are vanished

		- Caesar brags, even to his wife, that he has nothing to fear, because others fear him when they see his face

		> *Caesar:* Danger knows full well / that *Caesar* is more dangerous than he. 
		> We are two lions littered in one day, / and I the elder and more terrible;

		- He even personifies danger to say that he doesn't fear danger, and compares himself and danger with two lions to claim that he will be victorious over danger

		> *Caesar:* **Caesar** shall go forth
		> *Caesar:* *(**Caesar** Ã— a lot)*

		- Again, refers himself in the third person to build up his image

	- Uses this image to get his way, a lot

		> *Caesar:* I will not come today.
		> *Decius:* Let me know some cause, / lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.
		> *Caesar:* The cause is in my will; I will not come; / That is enough to satisfy the Senate.

		- Caesar basically says that he is not coming because he says he is not coming
		- Caesar expects the Senate to accept this reasoning

	- Falls for flattery

		> *Decius:* *(extremely flattering and completely inaccurate interpretation of Calphurnia's visions)*
		> *Caesar:* And this way have you well expounded it.
		> *Decius:* *(hints at senate planning to crown him)*
		> *Decius:* *(hints at senate mocking him for not coming because his wife is having bad dreams)*
		> *Caesar:* How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!

		- Caesar's ego is inflated by Decius' manipulative and flattering interpretations and views
		- He falls for Decius' manipulation so hard, he mocks his wife's concerns as "foolish"


## Actually quite fearful
> Although he puts on a show of being fearless and valiant, it is but an image;
> he is actually quite fearful due to his superstitions.

- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	- Only requests his closest servants for help

		> *Caesar:* Let me have men about me that are fat, / sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights
		> Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look; / he thinks too much. Such men are dangerous

		- He secretly confides with Antony his fears of Cassius
		- He only tells Antony his request for fat (i.e. satisfied, not hungry and at peace with self) bodyguards, so as to not spoil his public image of bravery

	- ...yet claims he doesn't need help anyway

		> *Caesar:* Would he were fatter. But I fear him not

		- Immediately after saying that Cassius is dangerous, he claims he has nothing to fear from him
		- Shows his maintenance of public image

		> *Caesar:* Yet if my name were liable to fear, / I do not know the man I should avoid / so soon as that spare Cassius

		- he even acknowledges how his "name" is not "liable to fear"

	- ...and doesn't even follow his own advice

		> *Caesar:* Such men as he be never at heart's ease / whiles they behold a greater than themselves, / and therefore are they **very dangerous**

		> *Caesar:* I rather tell thee what is to be feared / than what I fear; for always **I am Caesar**.

		- ...?!
		- He makes very accurate deductions of Cassius' behaviour and intents, but refuses to follow his own advice, for the sake of making himself look fearless and immortal
