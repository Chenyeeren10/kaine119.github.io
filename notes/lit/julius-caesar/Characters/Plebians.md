# The Plebians
[TOC]
## The Tributaries
### Marullus
#### Vindictive, angry
- *Act __1__, Scene __1__*:
	- lines 6-9

		> Where is thy leather apron and thy rule? What dost thou with thy best apparel on?

		- Rhetorical questions meant to embarass the plebians

	- lines 35-58, when he's lecturing the plebs

		> You **blocks**, you **stones**, you **worse than senseless** things!

		- namecalling: he compares them to inanimate, insensitive things, which shows his contempt

		> **And do you now** put on your best attire?
		> **And do you now** cull out a holiday?
		> **And do you now** strew flowers in his way / That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?

		- **Repetition for effect**: this emphasises Marullus' disapproval and anger, and makes the plebians feel guilty. 
		- **Rhetorical questions**: makes the plebians question their own motives, thus making them feel guilty

		> Be gone!

		- short, curt statement directed at the plebians

		> Pray to the gods to intermit **the plague**
		> That needs must light **on this ingratitude**

		- strongly emotive, angry words: he curses them to a plague
		- hyperbolic: he treats their change of support as a sin requiring divine punishment


####Easily agitated
- _Act **1**, Scene **1**_: 
	- line 17, 20, when cobbler is punning

		> Thou **naughty** trade, what trade?

		- Strong language &mdash; *"naughty"* used to mean useless/worthless &mdash; shows Marullus' anger

		> What meanest thou by that? Mend me, you **saucy** fellow?

		- *"saucy"* is an insult, meaning rude and cheeky

### Flavius
#### Friendly, empathetic
- *Act __1__, Scene __1__*
	- Throughout the scene

		> these **men**
		> good **countrymen**
		>> (in contrast to Marullus:)
		>> naughty knaves
		>> You **blocks**, you **stones**, you **worse than senseless** things!

		- Flavius respects the plebians more than Marullus, enough to address them as fellow Romans

	- Lines 10 to 29

		> _abscence of any lines of scolding/mockery_

		- Flavius appears to be amused by this; he is probably on the side chuckling to himself


## The other plebians
#### Generally light-hearted, playful
- *Act __1__, Scene __1__*
	- The many puns the cobbler makes in lines 10-30
	
		> Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a **cobbler**

		- "cobbler" can either mean a shoemaker, or a clumsy workperson 

		> A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad **soles**

		- "soles" rhymes with "souls", which, along with the express hope of a safe conscience, implies that he's a priest 

		> be not out with me; yet if **you be out**, sir, **I can mend you**
		
		- "you be out": either really angry, mad and insane or _out of heel_ (worn out) 

		> all that I live by is with the awl
		
		- more punning 

		> I meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters
		
		- A reference to previous play (**may not be relevant** to character!) 

		> I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I recover them
		
		- Tries to be lofty about his profession 

#### Easily swayed
- *Act __1__, Scene __1__*
	- lines 40-58

		> - Knew you not Pompey?
		> - you climbed up to walls and battlements
		> - infants in your arms
		> - sat the livelong day, with patient expectation, to see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
		> - made an universal shout, / That Tiber trembled underneath her banks / To hear the replication of your sounds / Made in her concave shores

		- Demonstrates the immense amount of admiration and support that the plebians had for Pompey; the **dedication** taken to see him "pass the streets of Rome" and the **roar of approval** that made a *great river tremble* (&mdash; hyperbole)

		> And do you now put on your best attire?
		> And do you now cull out a holiday?
		> And do you now strew flowers in his way / That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?

		- ...and how quickly the plebians switch alliegances; the contrast between the people they support, and the similarities between how much suppport each person got, shows how easy the plebians are to sway

#### Recognises & respects authority
- _Act **1**, Scene **1**_
	- Line 64

		> * _no lines of protest_
		> * _[Exeunt **all** the plebians_

		- Nobody questions the tributaries' mockery and scolding, nor do they defend their position
		- Everybody leaves, probably subdued
