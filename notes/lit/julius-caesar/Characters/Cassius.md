# Cassius
[TOC]

## Self-centred
- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	- Hatred against Caesar stems from his own personal grudge against him, not for the fact he's a dishonourable leader

		> **I** cannot tell what you and other men think of this life
		> **I** had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such thing as **I** myself
		> Accotred as **I** was, **I** plunged in
		> *(repetition of himself)*

		- Cassius' argument of Caesar being dishonourable is based on how Cassius is more honourable than him
		- The repetition of the word "I" shows that he is only thinking of himself and his merit over Caesar, showing his self-centered nature and his [jealousy of Caesar](#jealous-of-caesar)

## Jealous of Caesar
- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	- Argument against Caesar stems from personal grudge

		> *(repetition of "I", as mentioned [in his self-centered nature](#self-centred))*
		> *Cassius:* Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius", as a sick girl
		> *Cassius:* it doth amaze me / a man of such feeble temper should / so get the start of the majestic world

		- His repetition of the word "I" shows that his argument stems not from the betterment of Rome as Brutus believes it to be, but from a personal grudge against Caesar
		- His mocking, bitter tone shows his animosity and hatred of Caesar, thus showing his jealousy
		

## Manipulative, cunning, astute, an opportunist
- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	- Was planning to use Brutus to get at Caesar

		> Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.
		> If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, / he should not humour me

	- First tries to flatter Brutus

		> it is very much lamented, Brutus, / that you have no such mirrors as will turn / your hidden worthiness into your eye

		- He praises Brutus highly, and tries to get on his good side
		- Brutus sees through this, probably because of his cautious or his humble nature:

		> *Brutus:* Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, / that you would have me seek into myself / For that which is not in me?

		---

	- ...then takes advantage of his sense of honour

		> *Brutus:* I do fear the people / choose Caesar for their king *(an involuntary statement)*
		> *Cassius:* Ay, do you fear it? / Then must I think you would not have it so  

		> *(...)*  

		> *Brutus:* For let the gods so speed me as **I love / the name of honour** more than I fear death.
		> *Cassius:* [...] Well, honour is the subject of my story

		- An opportunist, he takes advantage of Brutus involuntarily revealing his deep sense of honour, and reframes his recruitment of Brutus, to try and prove Caesar is not an honourable leader:

		> *Cassius:* And this man / Is now become a god, and Cassius is / A wretched creature

		---


	- ...and paints Caesar in a very negative light in order to incite him to action

		> Caesar said to me, "Dar'st thou Cassius now / leap in with me into this angry flood, / and swim to yonder point?"
		> Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink."

		> Tis true, this god did shake, / His coward lips did from their colour fly

		> it doth amaze me / a man of such feeble temper should / so get the start of the majestic world / and bear the palm alone.

		> Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world / like a colossus, and we petty men / walk under his huge legs, and peep about / to find ourselves dishonourable graves

		- He doesn't directly propose that he join the conspiracy to kill Caesar
		- Highlights Caesars faults and dishonour in order to persuade him to join as a conspirator

		---

	- ...as well as appealing to Brutus' strong belief in ancestry and pride in heritage

		> There was a Brutus once that would have brooked / Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome / As easily as a king

		- "a Brutus once" refers to Lucius Julius Brutus, who drove the Tarquin kings, who were tyrants, out of Rome
		- Cassius reminds Brutus of this to persuade him to follow in his ancestor's footsteps and drive Caesar out of Rome, as Lucius drove the Tarquins out of Rome
		- Also helps to liken Caesar to the Tarquin Kings, further pushing the idea that Caesar is a tyrant 

		---

	- Takes advantage of Brutus' own words 

		> *Brutus:* 'Tis very ulike; he hath the falling-sickness
		> *Cassius:* No, Caesar hat it not; but you, and I, / and honest Casca, we have the falling sickness

		- Cassius uses Brutus' words to make a powerful statement implying that everyone else is falling under the domination of Caesar

- *Act __1__, Scene __3__*
	- Provokes Casca by saying he's a coward

		> You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life / that should be in a Roman you do want

		- implying that Casca is a coward


	- Takes advantage of stormy night to propose an interpretation that fits him

		> heaven hath infused them with these spirirs / to make them instruments of fear and warning / unto some monstrous state
		> could I [...] name to thee a man / most like this dreadful night

		- Cassius plays on Casca's fear of omens and superstition, to get his attention
		- Cassius chooses this interpretation on purpose so that Casca might think of Caesar, which he does:

		> *Casca:* 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius

		---

	- Provokes Casca's innate patriotism

		> woe the while, our fathers' minds are dead, / and we are governed with our mothers' spirits; / our yoke and sufferance shows us womanish

		- Cassius describes Romans as not men:
			- Romans have "become womanishe"
			- Romans now lack bravery, are weak and are subservient

		> What trash is Rome, / what rubbish, and what offal, when it serves / for the base matter to illuminate / so vile a thing as Caesar

		- Cassius uses strong language to show how far the Roman spirit has deteriorated

	- Then guilt-trips Casca

		> O grief, / where has thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this / before a willing bondman
		(...)
		> I am armed, and dangers are to me indifferent

		- Cassius suddenly accuses Casca of being a "willing bondman"
			- provokes Casca's pride of freedom over slavery
			- makes Casca determined to prove his worth
		- ...and makes himself look noble
			- shows Casca that Cassius is determined to his cause and would never surrender
			- Embodies the Roman spirit that he is proud of

	- Planning to use Brutus for his influence

		> *Casca:* O, he sits high in all the people's hearts; / and that which would appear offence in us, / his countenance, like richest alchemy, / will change to virtue and to worthiness
		> *Cassius:* [...] our great need of him / you have right well conceited

		- Cassius wants Brutus to join his conspiracy for his public approval; his appearance in the conspiracy will make the public believe their cause is noble because Brutus is part of it

- *Act __2__, Scene __1__*
	- Appeals to Brutus' pride in his heritage

		> My ancestors did from the streets of Rome / The Tarquin drive, when he was called a king

		- Cassius is aware of Brutus' intense pride in his forefathers, and he crafts his letters such that he thinks of his ancestors' actions in driving dictators from the republic

	- Backs off and gives Brutus "leadership" of the conspiracy

		> *does not interject during Brutus' refusal to take an oath*
		>> *Brutus:* O name him not; [...]
		>> *Cassius:* Then leave him out.

		- Cassius defers to Brutus' leadership and lets him lead the discussion, giving him what he wants to get him to stay in the consipracy

## Somewhat impulsive
- *Act __3__, Scene __1__*
	- Worries about their conspiracy being discovered, overreacts

		> Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention
		> I will slay myself

		- Cassius becomes slightly hysterical, threatening to kill himself 
		- Overreacts and enjoins Casca to act prematurely, which would have led to disaster
		- shows a volatile, excitable character
