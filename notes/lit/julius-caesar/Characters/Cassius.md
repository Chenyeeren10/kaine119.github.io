# Cassius
## Manipulative
- *Act __1__, Scene __2__*
	

- *Act __2__, Scene __1__*
	- Appeals to Brutus' pride in his heritage

		> My ancestors did from the streets of Rome / The Tarquin drive, when he was called a king

		- Cassius is aware of Brutus' intense pride in his forefathers, and he crafts his letters such that he thinks of his ancestors' actions in driving dictators from the republic

	- Backs off and gives Brutus "leadership" of the conspiracy

		> *does not interject during Brutus' refusal to take an oath*
		>> *Brutus:* O name him not; [..]
		>> *Cassius:* Then leave him out.

		- Cassius defers to Brutus' leadership and lets him lead the discussion, giving him what he wants to get him to stay in the consipracy
