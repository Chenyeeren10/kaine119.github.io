# Brutus

[TOC]

## Inner conflict
- Debate between whether to stay loyal to Caesar or assassinate him for the betterment of Rome
	- A1S2

	> Vexed I am / Of late with passions of some difference, / conceptions only proper to myself
	> poor Brutus, with himself at war

	- A2S1: 

		> "I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly"
		> "Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, / I have not slept"

		>> Between the acting of a dreadful thing _(decision)_
		>> And the first motion, _(action)_
		>> all the interim is like a phantasma, or a hideous dream

		> The genius `(mind)` and the mortal instruments `(body)`
		> Are then in council `(at war)`, and the state of man, 
		> like to a little kingdom, suffers then
		> the nature of an insurrection

		> I have been up this hour, awake all night

		- Brutus very undecided, trauma of decision causes him to lose sleep

- Eventually gives in, decides to assassinate Caesar
	- "It must be by this death"
		- Monosyllabic, plosive, strongly pronounced words
		- shows heavy, resolute decision
		- => makes audience curious about the reason for his decision, builds anticipation

## Characteristics
### Generally serious, sober
- Not fond of sports
- Generally doesn't have a lively demeanour (in **contrast** to Antony)
> *Act __1__, Scene __2__*: I am not gamesome...   
- Doesn't panic, acts rationally in times of panic
> Cassius, be constant. / Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes
	- Reassures Cassius that nothing is happening
	- Displays swift, strong, assertive reaction consistent with good leadership
	- Admonition to "be **constant**" stands in contrast with Cassius panicing of "be **sudden**"

### Not hasty, guarded
- Wary, suspicious, alert
> _Act 1 Scene 2, when Cassius starts praising him_
	Into what dangers would lead me, Cassius, / that you would have me seek into myself / that which is not in me?
- Careful, perceptive enough to know Cassius' intent, does not rush into committing himself
> _Act 1 Scene 2, when he makes his decision_
	What you would work me to, I have some aim

---

### Ponderous, thinks deeply
- Anxious about Caesar's rise in power
- ⇒ becomes distant from freinds, thinks things through himself
> "If I have veiled my look, / I turn the trouble of my countenance / merely on myself"

---

### Principled
**Cassius uses this to manipulate Brutus!**

- Man of honour, integrity
- Will not compromise these values, but will **do anything** for the **greater good** of Rome
- Patriotic, son of Rome: willing to self-sacrifice for Rome
> _Act 1 Scene 3:_
	If it be aught toward the _general good_ of Rome, / set honour in one eye and death i'the other, / And I will look on both indifferently  
	For let the gods so speed me as **I love / the name of honour more than I fear death**  
- Has **sense of duty** to Rome
> _Act 1 Scene 3_
	Brutus had rather be a villager / Than to repute himself aa sone of Rome / under these hard conditions as this time / is like to lay upon us
- Brutus does things for the noble cause of the greater good
- Does not decide to assassinate Caesar over personal grudges, but for the greater good of Rome
> *Act __2__, Scene __1__*
	"I know no personal cause to spurn at him, / but for the general"

### Self-deluded
- Tries to convince himself that Caesar must die
> *Act 2, Scene 1, when debating with himself*
> - *use of the words:* Fashion it thus...
> - Use of **hypotheses**, concept of **prevention**
> - Uses common proofs to hypothesise

### Gullible
- Believes notes are actually from people of Rome who want him to displace Caesar
- Doesn't verify or check with people, to see if they really are suffering under Caesar
- Falls into trap of believing it's his responsibility to act for the people
> *Act 2 Scene 1, reading the letters*:
	Am I entreated / to speak, and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise / if the redress will follow, thou receivest / thy full petition at the hands of Brutus

### Not a good judge of character
- Not shrewd, not astute
- Lacks perceptiveness of Mark Antony, completely misjudges him
- **FATAL ERROR OF JUDGEMENT** here: brushes aside Cassius' reservations
> - Thinks of Mark Antony as "**but a limb of Caesar**"
> 	- one who can't do anything "like Caesar's arm when Caesar's head is cut off" 
> - thinks Mark Antony can only kill himself in grief, won't even do that b/c he's too fond of enjoying life

### Intensely proud of Roman spirit
- *Act __2__, Scene __1__*
	- Believes in Roman honesty and infallibility

		> What other bond / Than secret **Romans**, that have spoke the word, / And will not palter?

		- Firmly believes that **true** Romans don't need to take oaths because their words are as strong as oaths

### Naïve, idealistic
_(to the point of delusion)_

- Naturally open, honest
- Concept of conspiracy is __anathema__, finds subterfuge and dissembling __abhorrent__
- ⇒ doesn't like it that conspirators cover faces when they arrive at his home
> *Act 2 Scene 1, when the conspirators arrive*
	O conspiracy, / sham'st thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, / when evils are most free?

---

- Believes that everyone's motives arae noble, their characters strong and sincere
- ⇒ there's no need to take an oath
> *Act __2__, Scene __1__, when discussing with conspirators*
	What other bond / Than secret **Romans**, that have spoke the word, / And will not palter?
- opposes Cassius' suggestion that Mark Antony should be killed as well
> * Cassius: Antony is a "shrewd contriver", will "annoy" them all
> * Brutus: Course will seem **"too bloody"**, seem like "wrath" and "envy"
- deluded about the gravity of their plotting; unrealistic idealism
> * Caesar should be "carved as a dish _fit for the Gods_", and not "butchered" or "hewed as a carcass fit for hounds" 
> * they are standing up "against the spirit of Caesar", and "in the spirit of men there is no blood"

### Highly regarded
- Has honourable reputation, enjoys respect, highly regarded by the Romans
- Cassius and his conspiracy intend to use his repute and influence
	> *Casca:* O, he sits high in all the people's hearts; / and that which would appear offence in us, / his countenance, like richest alchemy, / will change to virtue and to worthiness

- Other conspirators agree with whatever Brutus says, against their better judgement, because they _need_ him in the conspiracy
