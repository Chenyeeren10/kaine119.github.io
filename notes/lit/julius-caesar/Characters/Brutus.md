# Brutus

[TOC]

## Inner conflict
- Debate between whether to stay loyal to Caesar or assassinate him for the betterment of Rome
	- A1S2: "Brutus, at war with himself"
	- A2S1: 

		> "I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly"
		> "Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, / I have not slept"

		>> Between the acting of a dreadful thing _(decision)_
		>> And the first motion, _(action)_
		>> all the interim is like a phantasma, or a hideous dream

		> The genius `(mind)` and the mortal instruments `(body)`
		> Are then in council `(at war)`, and the state of man, 
		> like to a little kingdom, suffers then
		> the nature of an insurrection

		> I have been up this hour, awake all night

		- Brutus very undecided, trauma of decision causes him to lose sleep

- Eventually gives in, decides to assassinate Caesar
	- "It must be by this death"
		- Monosyllabic, plosive, strongly pronounced words
		- shows heavy, resolute decision
		- => makes audience curious about the reason for his decision, builds anticipation

## Characteristics
### Noble, with pure intentions
- *Act __2__, Scene __1__*
	- "I know no personal cause to spurn at him, / but for the general"
		- Brutus does things for the noble cause of the greater good
		- Does not decide to assassinate Caesar over personal grudges, but for the greater good of Rome

### Intensely proud of Roman spirit
- *Act __2__, Scene __1__*
	- Believes in Roman honesty and infallibility

		> What other bond / Than secret **Romans**, that have spoke the word, / And will not palter?

		- Firmly believes that **true** Romans don't need to take oaths because their words are as strong as oaths

### NaÃ¯ve, idealistic
- *Act __2__, Scene __1__*
	- Believes that everyone speaks the truth and is acting for the benefit of Rome

		> What other bond / Than secret **Romans**, that have spoke the word, / And will not palter?

		- Believes that _all_ Romans speak the truth and nothing but the truth
		- Does not suspect that other consiprators might not be as truthful and noble as he is

		> Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers
		> Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods

		- "Sacrificers" implies that their killing of Caesar is one fit for the Gods, and that they're doing this for the whole of Rome
		- Brutus believes that their assassination is for Rome, and not for any of the conspirator's own personal gain, hence the allusion to a holy sacrifice

		> We shall be called purgers, not murderers

		- "Purge" connotates the removal of disease and illness
		- Brutus thinks that they are removing Caesar from power to help Roem get rid of his tyranny

	- Fatally misreads Antony

		> Antony is but a limb of Caesar
		> All that he can do / Is to himself, take thought, and die for Caesar

		- Brutus is not astute enough to sense characteristics beyond the surface and read Antony correctly
		- Too idealistic to be a good politician, takes everyone at face value
