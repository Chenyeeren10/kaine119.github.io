### Leadership roles

> HSBC-commissioned survey conducted by Economist Intelligence Unit in Singapore on March 2016

- 56% of Singaporean Women feel they're under-represented in top positions
- while 69% and 74% of senior female professionals in Malaysia and Indonedia feel it's they're responsibility to help other women, only 56% in Singapore say the same

> A 2013 study by the Colorado Women's College at the University of Denver, entitled **"Benchmarking Women's Leadership in the United States"**

- On average, women 
	- hold **less than 20% of leadership positions**
	- **earn less** than male counterparts
	- by some measures, are **outperforming male peers** across various sectors
- Women have **better presence** in **top performers** as measured by industry-specific assessments
- **disproves** idea that women prefer less demanding, time-consuming positions to accomodate family
- Female leaders lead to **increased** revenue, sales, impact and reach, as well as more industry distinctions
- **Newer sectors** have better female representation in leadership positions
- The lack of women in positional leadership roles is mostly due to an **inherent bias** against women as leaders

> Numerous other studies benchmarking women's leadership in individual sectors

- despite legislative changes, women are **underrepresented and underpaid**, yet **overperforming**
- Common factors cited include
	- investing in family instead of work
	- chosen fields of study that don't align with leadership positions
	- "lifestyle" preferences
	- (typically inferred) women are "choosing" to not pursue senior level roles, to not work at all
		- *in reality*, most have no economic choice except to work and seek help in professional progression & leadership positions

- 2013: female full-time workers made **78¢** for every $1 earned by men, a gap of 22%
	- for virtually every single occupation
- If change continues as slowly as the past fifty years, it'll take **44 years** for women's pay to feach parity with men's

> A paper from the American Association of University Women

- Pay gap has only improved **extremely slightly**
	- 2013: women still paid 78% of what men were paid
- **Some states have worse pay gaps** than others

- Women in **all occupations** face a wage gap
	- Women are paid less than men in **female-dominated, gender-balanced and male-dominated** fields
- Wage gap grows with age
	- Until the age of 35, women typically earn 90% of what men earn
	- After 35, median earnings are about 75-80% of what men are paid
- Education, while helping with absolute earnings, don't help with wage gap
	- At **every level** of academic achievement, women's median earnings are still less than men's earnings
	- In some cases at higher levels of academic achievement, the wage gap is even wider than at lower levels of education
- Pay gap exists, even without children
	- Among full time workers **just after graduation, with no children**, women paid just 82% of what their male counterparts made

- Upon further questioning, employees of both genders described past situations of gender bias against women, but they were
	- from external organisations
	- from an isolated, "older" male colleague
- Interpretations
	- workers "acknowledge that it can happen but **construct is as singular events** that happened in the past, **placing the onus on women** to overcome such obstacles"
	- workers display "gender fatigue", where people are tired of dealing with gender discrimination
		- an **obstruction** to **productive discussion** regarding gender discrimination
