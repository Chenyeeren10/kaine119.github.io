> Not everything on the Internet (__or media in general__) is trustworthy or accurate

* Advertising: editorial pieces can be manipulated to advertise a product, hence its content may not be entirely accurate
* Openness of media platforms: many media platforms online are "crowdsourced", meaning that they depend on user contributions
	- Since the content on these platforms are user-contributed, they may not be accurate
	- e.g: Social media websites like Facebook or Reddit, blogs, even purely informational sites like Wikipedia
* Media bias, censorship or state-controlled media
	- News channels or websites may be owned by a government or political party whom, to make themselves appear better or propogate a mindset, may alter their content from the truth
		+ Fox News in particular has come under fire for pushing their conservative views in news segments

		+ Project Censored, a campaign to raise awareness of censorship in media, releases a collection of news stories that corporate media ignores

	- social media can be addictive 
	- Using Facebook as an example, he explains:
	> 'There's a voyeuristic tendency none of us realized would be so high. [...] We're all interested in what others are doing. Facebook does something you could never really do before and it can really get intoxicating."
* a psychiatrist and neuroscience reasercher in Columbia University:
	* Symptoms for Internet addiction can be similar to addiction to anything else, fall into two types of behaviours: 
		- an ever increasing need to engage with the object of the addiction
		- bad feeling when not getting enough of it.
