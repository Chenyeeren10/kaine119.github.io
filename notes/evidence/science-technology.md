		- Ruling party was *accused* of **hiring 40,000 foreign workers** from Bangladesh **to vote**. 
		- Many people **took the rumour as _genuine_** 
		- Many even **wanted** to heed the **call of non-governmental organisations** on **social media** to **arrest the _purported_ phantom voters** at polling stations.

## Social Life
