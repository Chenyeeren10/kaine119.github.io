# Sustainable Development

[TOC]

# Causes
## Water pollution
> UN's World Economic and Social Survey from 2013

- Fertilizer use
	- Increased by 700% since 1960
	- Fertilizer use __degrades water quality, threatends biodiversity__ and endangers __resilience of marine ecosystems__

# Problems
## Atmospheric pollution

> World Bank, 2012

- Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased from *__260ppm__ in preindustrial times* to *__391ppm__ in September 2012*
- Global mean warming already 0.8&deg;C above pre-industrial levels

## Waste
> World Bank figures, cited in Global Partnership on Waste Management conference

- 1.3 billion tonnes of municipal waste generated every year
	- Expected to increase to 2.2 billion tonnes by 2025
- Population growth, urbanisation and economic development producing increasing quantities of waste
- 1% of urban population in developing countries sift through trash for living
	- Still accounts for millions
	- exposed to hazardous substances like lead, mercury, and infectious agents from healthcare facilities

## Deforestation
> United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation

- 18 million acres of forest lost every year, equivalent to size of Panama
- 36 American football fields of trees lost every minute
- Half of world's tropical forests have been cleared

> WWF

- a third of worlds's arable land has been lost to deforestation since 1960
- Caused by
	- usage of wood as fuel
	- making land available for housing and urbanisation, cattle ranching
	- timber harvesting for commercial items

> Greenpeace

- Trees absorb 300 billion tonnes of carbon, 40 times the annual greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels

> 2010 Global Forest Resources Assessment

- deforestation releases nearly a billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere per year

## Effects on people
> UN's World Economic and Social Survey from 2013

- Significant negative impact on global maize and wheat yields



# Roles
## More developed countries
> UN's World Economic and Social Survey from 2013

- Developed countries responsible for almost 60% of cumulative emissions
- However, contribute little to emissions *growth*
- Developed countries *import **emissions-intensive products** from **developing countries***
	- if emissions **transfers** taken into account, developed countries have not been able to stabalise emission contribution
- Developed countries still emit more
	- Per-capita emissions in *US* are **5x** global average
	- Per-capita emissions in least-developed countries are mere **one-tenth** global average
- Developing countries and the poor __contributed least to global warming__, yet likely to suffer __the worst__

## Less developed countries
> UN's World Economic and Social Survey from 2013

- **emissions growth** driven by China, India, other **developing countries**
	- China now **single largest contributor** to global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
	- emitted **9.7 billion tons** in 2011, **29%** of all emissions

> 2014 study of air pollution in India

- More than half the country's population live in reigons with air pollution levels **higher than India's national standards**
	- Cutting **3 years** off average life expectancy
- 99.5% of the population live in reigons with air pollution higher than **World Health Organisation**'s air pollution standards  
- Previous year, **Environment Minister** claimed to put **economic growth** and **poverty alleviation** over environmental concerns
	⇒ more coal energy ⇒ higher emissions

> WWF article on environmental concerns in China

- **Ill-planned** waterway projects **interrupt rivers**, conversion of wetlands for agriculture **destroys ecosystems** and **drive animals out of homes**
- One-quarter of species considered critically endangered by **Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITIES)** found in China

- Waste poured from factories and cities have polluted major rivers in China
	- **40%** of the water in river systems is **unfit for human consumption

> Report from China's Ministry of Land and Resources in 2014

- 60% of groundwater can't be used for drinking
- Same month, benzene, a carcinogenic, was found in water supplies
	- Utilities company says pollution was due to industrial contamination

> GRID-Arendal, a United Nations Environment Program collaborating center

- Current Significant deforesters include Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, the Congo and other parts of Africa, and parts of Eastern Europe
	(i.e. developing countries)
- Deforestation not just by developing countries though
	- 90% of the US's indigenous forests have been removed since 1600

> 2013 study published by TCO, a confederation of 15 Swedish trade unions

- World leaders have failed to pull people out of poverty while avoiding effects of climate change
- China
	- grown very quickly, more than ten times, with many millions lifted out of poverty
	- also topped energy efficiency measures, becoming 77% more efficient per GDP unit
	- despite efficiency, sheer volume causes China's massive CO<sub>2</sub> emmisions (**six times** more than in 1972)
	- to keep pace with development, China invested heavily in fossil fuels
		- renewable industry grown dramatically, but now only accouts for 14% of electricity supply

## The government

> China's water pollution plan

- Sets ambitious goals for cleaning up heavily polluted bodies of water
	- by 2020, 70% of major rivers should be in good condition
	- will rise to 75% by 2030
	- contains 26 detailed requirements
- Measures
	- 238 measures, in total
	- preservation zones will be set up for major rivers, preventing industrial pollution
	- small factories in paper and pestidide production, tanning, and other pollutors will be shut down
	- closer scrutiny will be paid to highly polluting industries

## The people

## The international community
> International agreements

- Paris Climate Deal
- Millennium Development goals
	- to cut extreme poverty, hunger and disease by 2015
	> Real challenge is to turn those fragile and unfulfilled global committments into real solutions
	> &mdash; Director of Earth Institute at Columbia University
- Public committments make a difference!
	- US pledged internally to cut emissions by 17% from 2005 to 2020, became more committed after openly pledging in Copenhagen
	- Obama administration subsequently rolled out regulations and other policies to meet goal

> (maybe not)

- Economically speaking, makes sense for countries to ask others to act, while doing as little as possible themselves
	- if everyone does this, nothing gets done
- Countries might do it themselves anyway, but for reasons other than sustainability
	- China facing _health issues_ from coal dependency
- Countries are able to keep track of each other without the need for mediators

# Solutions
## Recycling
> 2010 report from United Nations Environment Programme

- In Northern Europe, recycling a tonne of paper and aluminium saves 600kg and 10 000kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent respectively
- 65 times more gold in one tonne of old mobile phones than in a tonne of ore

# Cost of sustainable development
> Director of Earth Institute at Columbia University

- Most solutions are surprisingly cheap for developed countries
	- Solutions like hybrid cars, solar energy and better management of land can be implemented for **less than 1% of annual wold income**
	- Antimalarial bed nets in Africa
		- 300 million are needed
		- Bed nets for malaria protection in Africa cost $5 and last 5 years, totalling to **$1.5 billion**
		- Still less tahn *__one day's worth__ of US Pentagon expenses*
