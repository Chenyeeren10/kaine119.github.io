	- Dr Chong, senior fellow at Institute of Southeast Asian Studies: 
		- > "Nostalgia is the sweet imagination of the past when the present if found wanting"
		- > "the **influx of foreigners** and the **unrelenting urban development** mean that we are changing in a **stream of change**, which can be **_discomforting_ and _disorientating_**"
	- Dr Chua Ai Lin, President of Singapore Heritage Society and NUS historian:
		- > Singaporeans "unable to catch up with their country's development"
		- > "Singapore changes especially fast", resulting in "**gentrification**, or the neighbourhood being displaced by new users"
	- Assistant Prof Loh Kah Seng, teaching at Sogang University's Institute for East Asian Studies:

		- > shown in increasing numbers of "folkish but fashionable cafes, bookstores and other entrepreneurial ventures"

# Implications of preserving a national identity
- Lead to Singaporeans being more informed and aware of the country's past, effedctively become a more mature polity
- Strengthening of national identity, interpersonal bonds
	- NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser:
		- > "about collective identity, sense of belonging, pride, values, and priorities for the future"
		- > "Singapore was experienced more as an economy, rather than a nation"
		- > "There is now greater identity and pride"
- Greater pressure on the government to preserve cultural heritage
	- National Heritage Board
		- formed an impact assessment and mitigation division, to study the effect that development has on Singapore's heritage
- "Museumification" of heritage and history
	- Dr Chong: 
		- > Preserving heritage sites as if they were museums
		- > "aesthetically beautiful, but not a leap at the holistic level"
- Rise of socio-cultural clashes, as mentioned by SUTD lecturer Dr Nazry Bahrawi
	- if national identity feeds the idea that there is an "authentic singapore", xenophobia can arise
	- people might start feeling entitled to "a land of one's own, and worse, a sense of purity"
- short-sightedness, fixation
	- President of Singapore Heritage Society and NUS historian Dr Chua Ai Lin: danger of singapore becoming too focused on resent past, and not the deeper past
	- National Library Board deputy director of engagement, Mr Wan Wee Pin: a tendency to view the past through rose-tinted glasses, only seeing the good of the past and turning a blind eye to the bad parts
	- Mr Wan: if people hang on to the past too much, "you are longing for things that no longer exist and therefore you face a struggle"
